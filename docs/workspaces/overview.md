# Overview

A workspace is your organization's private space for calling Functions, building Flows, and managing Integrations of your Users. Everyone in your team can collaborate on building flows, generate the embed code, view users and their integrations, troubleshoot their runs.

#### Can we have additional workspaces? <a href="#h_01hnjq6nxvppwvwtp8jmzt5hbw" id="h_01hnjq6nxvppwvwtp8jmzt5hbw"></a>

Yes, organizations on an Enterprise license can add up to two additional workspaces. Each workspace will have it's own flows, team members, users and integrations. However, all workspaces tied to one license will be billed together and, hence, can consume a common task bundle.
