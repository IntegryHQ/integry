# Workspace Variables

Instead of hard-coding static values (eg. your API's base URL), you can define a workspace variable and consume it in all your flows.

1. Go to Workspace Settings -> Variables.
2. Add the variables under Workspace Variables.

If you ever need to change a value, simply go back there and change it.

You can reference all user variables in flow steps.

1. In the body section of an HTTP Call step, click Add tag -> Workspace Variables. ![Screenshot 2024-10-08 at 10.09.32â€¯AM.png](https://docs.integry.ai/hc/article_attachments/38606605602585)
