# Access Control and Testing

## Controlling access

You control the access of each app, function and flow in your workspace. They can be accessed by:

* All users
* [Beta users only](../users/testing-with-beta-users.md)
* No one

### Configure access for a Function (Coming soon)

1. Go to Functions.
2. Click a function to open configure screen.
3. Toggle to Access.
4. Set **The function can be accessed by** to the desired option.

## Testing

Beta users can test apps, functions or flows from within the Integry app, or from the embedded UI in your app.

### Testing from the Integry app

Go to **Functions** and click **View as a User**.

It opens the embeddable UI in a modal. This view is **live**, i.e., you are accessing it as a real user, and all changes you make will impact connected accounts and execute functions of the selected user.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, your user ID will be selected. If you want, you can select a different user to **impersonate** but please remember that this is **live** and changes cannot be reversed.
{% endhint %}

If the selected user is a Beta User, you should see additional functions that only Beta users can access. Feel free to test your new ideas. When you're ready to release them, go back and make the function accessible to _All users_.

### Testing in your app

The embedded UI in your app will automatically show additional functions that only Beta users can access. No further action is needed in Integry.

Feel free to test your new ideas. When you're ready to release them, go back to the Integry app and make the function accessible to _All users_.
