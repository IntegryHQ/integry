# Testing with Beta Users

You can set any user in your workspace to be a **Beta user**. It will automatically give them access to apps, functions and flows set to _Beta users only_. This makes it very easy to test new ideas with a small set of users before you make them accessible to _All users_.

Hereâ€™s how you do it:

1. Go to [Users](https://app.integry.io/platform/users/)
2. Search for a user&#x20;
3. Open the ... menu
4. Turn on 'Beta User'

To remove beta access, simply turn off 'Beta User'.
