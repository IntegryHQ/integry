# How is usage measured?

Integry has two usage models that you can pick from when you sign up: User-based pricing or Run-Based pricing. Here are the details for both

### **User-based pricing** <a href="#h_01hx4p2pbxcs43bas8g4gyye9k" id="h_01hx4p2pbxcs43bas8g4gyye9k"></a>

Pay per user of your app that sets up an integration

* A User can be an end-use, account or business in your app. The Integrations are visible to them.
* Access to all apps
* Setup any number of integrations
* Limited by your accountâ€™s throughput
* Volume discounts available
* Good for: when you have lots of integration usage per user

### **Run-based pricing** <a href="#id-01hx4p454hr87svmfy4qa70krz" id="id-01hx4p454hr87svmfy4qa70krz"></a>

Pay whenever an integration Runs

* A Run can pull in any amount of data
* Access to all apps
* Setup any number of integrations
* Fair usage applies
* Volume discounts available
* Good for: when you have sporadic usage per account

Depending upon how your SaaS app is priced and what your usage pattern looks like, one or the other model will make sense. Please reach out to your success manager if you need help in deciding. You can also [setup a call with sales](https://integry.ai/talk) to discuss your options.
