# What is a user?

A user is a user of your app who will access flows with other apps using the Integry widget embedded  within your app.

You will [pass Integry their user ID](broken-reference) when you embed the widget so Integry can associate their connected accounts and [integrations](../getting-started/key-concepts.md#h_01hnbfrb883b2v83p77esmk0xn) with them. That same user ID is how you will then identify them in the Users tab.

You can also configure Integry such that the user is an account or a business in your app. Whichever entity you treat as a user, it will be able to view, edit and create all integrations created.
