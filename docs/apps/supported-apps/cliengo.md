# Cliengo

[Cliengo](https://www.integry.io/apps/cliengo) is an online platform that interacts with your visitors and converts them to leads. Cliengo acts as a chat box for your company that helps you produce more sales. You can use it to save the data of the visitor with the chat box. Cliengo has a built-in CRM to make adding leads easy. It helps in escalating business processes by automation and also in generating reports. The Cliengo App Connector syncs and manages contacts with other third-party apps.&#x20;

### Specifications  <a href="#specifications-0-0" id="specifications-0-0"></a>

Before you connect your Cliengo account with Integry, here are a few things you need to learn about the Cliengo App Connector.&#x20;

#### Authorization Type  <a href="#authorization-type-0-1" id="authorization-type-0-1"></a>

Cliengo uses the [API key](https://support.integry.io/hc/en-us/articles/11112617800985-Authentication-Types-Supported-in-Integry) authorization method. An API key identifies the end-user, and Integry uses this key to communicate with Cliengo's API on behalf of that end-user.&#x20;

#### Trigger Type <a href="#trigger-type-0-2" id="trigger-type-0-2"></a>

Cliengo triggers are [poll-based](https://www.testpreptraining.com/tutorial/describe-polling-triggers-and-their-usage/). Integry will send a request to Cliengo every 5 minutes to collect data. In case of an occurrence of selected events, a trigger will be received at Integry with the required payload. When you set up an integration (in which Cliengo acts as a trigger application) and perform an action in Cliengo, expect a 5-minute delay for the trigger to be received at Integry.&#x20;
