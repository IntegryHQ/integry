# Airtable

[Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) is an online platform that allows you to create a custom database of apps tailored to your specific needs and workflows. It helps you to create a single source of features according to your team's work. It also helps you build custom interfaces that deliver relevant information to your team members, which they can use to plan their future actions. The Airtable App Connector syncs and manages records with other third-party apps.
