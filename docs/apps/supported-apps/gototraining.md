[GoToTraining](https://www.goto.com/training) is a web-hosted online training service. It offers online classroom and desktop sharing via the Internet in real time. It allows the desktop view of a host computer to be broadcast to a group of computers connected to the host through the Internet. You can use it to provide online training to your end-users on any device. It helps you manage online course catalogs, registration forms, and study material and accept payments.
