# Delighted

[Delighted](https://delighted.com/) is an online platform using Net Promoter Score to gather real customer feedback through customized surveys. You can use it to create targeted surveys, send SMS or analyze feedback through your website. This customizable platform adapts according to your brand and customers. It offers several surveys that allow you to gather a large amount of data. The Delighted App Connector syncs and manages people with other third-party apps.&#x20;

### Specifications  <a href="#specifications-0-0" id="specifications-0-0"></a>

Before you connect your Delighted account with Integry, here are a few things you need to learn about the Delighted App Connector.&#x20;

#### Authorization Type  <a href="#authorization-type-0-1" id="authorization-type-0-1"></a>

Delighted uses the [basic](https://support.integry.io/hc/en-us/articles/11112617800985-Authentication-Types-Supported-in-Integry) authorization type. The basic auth type usually asks for your username and password and authenticates using those. If anything else is needed, we add the details for it in the auth popup.&#x20;

#### Trigger Type <a href="#trigger-type-0-2" id="trigger-type-0-2"></a>

The triggers used here are [poll-based](https://www.testpreptraining.com/tutorial/describe-polling-triggers-and-their-usage/). Integry will send a request to Delighted every 5 minutes to collect data. In case of an occurrence of selected events, a trigger will be received at Integry with the required payload. Therefore, when you set up an integration (in which Delighted acts as a trigger application) and perform an action in Delighted, expect a 5-minute delay for the trigger to be received at Integry.&#x20;
