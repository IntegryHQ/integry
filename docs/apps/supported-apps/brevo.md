Sendinblue uses [API Key](https://support.integry.io/hc/en-us/articles/11112617800985-Authentication-Types-Supported-in-Integry) authorization type. The end-user is identified by an API key, and Integry uses this key to perform an API request to Sendinblue on behalf of that end-user.&#x20;

#### Trigger Type <a href="#h_01hqrsyszw51cxxz5ptwb34npj" id="h_01hqrsyszw51cxxz5ptwb34npj"></a>
