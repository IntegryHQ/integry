# Stripe

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is an online software that accepts payments, sends payouts, and manages businesses online.

It allows you to create websites and apps that send payouts and accept payments. It is extremely secure and helps you send invoices without fraud, have an easy checkout, manage your business spending, and issue virtual cards. The Stripe App Connector syncs and manages customers with other third-party apps.
