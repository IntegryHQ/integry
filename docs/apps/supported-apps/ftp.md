# FTP

FTP is a standard network protocol provided by TCP/IP that can be used for transmitting files between hosts over the internet. You can use it to keep the data from your files synced between a remote computer and any app. You can also use it to access a remote computer that isn't a dedicated server with credentials like IP address, username, password, and optionally a port. Using FTP, you can sync the data on any online app with files like Text and CSV on a remote computer. This integration will keep reading your file periodically to keep the data up-to-date. The FTP App Connector can be used to make a connection with the FTP server.

Before you connect your FTP account with Integry, here are a few things you need to learn about the FTP App Connector.

#### Authorization Type  <a href="#authorization-type-0-1" id="authorization-type-0-1"></a>

The authorization type is [API Key](https://support.integry.io/hc/en-us/articles/11112617800985-Authentication-Types-Supported-in-Integry). The API key identifies the end-user, and Integry uses this key to perform an API communication with FTP on behalf of that end-user.
