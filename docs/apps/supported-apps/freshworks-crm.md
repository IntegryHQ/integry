# Freshworks CRM

[Freshworks CRM](https://www.freshworks.com/crm/) is an online platform to get leads, boost customer engagement, drive deals to closure, and nurture existing customers. You can use it to view your customerâ€™s interactions and automate your tasks. It also provides customized infographics to the user. The Freshworks App Connector manages and syncs contacts with other third-party apps.

### Specifications  <a href="#specifications-0-0" id="specifications-0-0"></a>

Before you connect your Freshworks account with Integry, here are a few things you need to learn about the Freshworks App Connector.

#### Authorization Type  <a href="#authorization-type-0-1" id="authorization-type-0-1"></a>

Freshworks uses [API key+URL](https://support.integry.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022115853-Authentication-Types-Supported-in-Integry) authorization type. The API key and URL identify the end-user, and Integry uses this key to perform an API communication with Freshworks on behalf of that end-user.

You can find the above at Avatar > Settings > API Settings. Provide the API key as API Key and Bundle alias as URL.

#### Trigger Type <a href="#trigger-type-0-2" id="trigger-type-0-2"></a>

The triggers used are [poll-based](https://www.testpreptraining.com/tutorial/describe-polling-triggers-and-their-usage/). Integry will send a request to Freshworks every 5 minutes to collect data. In case of an occurrence of selected events, a trigger will be received at Integry with the required payload. Therefore, when you set up an integration (in which Freshworks acts as a trigger application) and perform an action in Freshworks, expect a 5-minute delay for the trigger to be received at Integry.

### Limitations <a href="#limitations-0-3" id="limitations-0-3"></a>
