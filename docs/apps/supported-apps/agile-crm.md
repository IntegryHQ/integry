# Agile CRM

[Agile CRM](https://www.integry.io/apps/agile-crm) is a customer relationship management software. It offers sales, marketing, and service CRM for small businesses. You can manage your contacts, and appointments along with one-click calling, and voicemail automation. In addition to managing your projects, you can also create marketing campaigns and embed social media platforms in them using the Social Suite. The Agile CRM App Connector syncs and manages contacts with other third-party apps.&#x20;
