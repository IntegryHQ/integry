# Unbounce

[Unbounce](https://www.integry.io/apps/unbounce) is an online platform that helps you engage with your target market by developing highly-optimized landing pages. You can design landing pages that convert your visitors into customers without writing a single line of code. Unbounce offers conversion-focused, industry-specific templates for landing pages. You can customize the templates by dragging and dropping design elements and adding custom images. Furthermore, Unbounce lets you publish SSL-encrypted landing pages. The Unbounce App Connector helps sync and manage leads with other third-party apps.&#x20;
